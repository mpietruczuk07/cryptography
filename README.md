# Cryptography
This repository contains several cryptographical algorithms I've created during Computer Network Security course at Bialystok University of Technology. All algorithms are written in Java and have a GUI implementation created with JavaFX.

**Basic Cryptographic Algorithms** - the implementation of transposition cipher algorithmss like Rail Fence, Columnar Transposition with numeric key and Columnar Transposition with text key.

**LFSR** - the implementation of stream cipher algorithm based on LFSR generator. You can encrypt and decrypt both text messages and diverse types of files.

**RSA** - the implementation of exponential cipher with the public key. It consists of all necessary components needed to encrypt and decrypt the message, such as: P and Q prime numbers generator, the Euclidean algorithm to find E number and algorithms to find D number.
